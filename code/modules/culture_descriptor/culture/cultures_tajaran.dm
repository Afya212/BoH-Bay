	are known as Monsians, the largest cultural group on the planet. Most Surfacers have had a decent upbringing and represent the \
	average level of comfort expected in Sol space. Most surfacers are like many across the galaxy, though a few harbour rivalries with other Martian cultural \
	groups or are generally overly proud of their heritage, as is the case with the Gideons, to the point that they constantly refer to it."
