	description = "Members oof the Ascent tend to be organized along the natural lines of their respective species. \
	For Kharmaani, this is oriented around individual gynes and their power structures. Monarch Serpentids have a slightly less \
	manipulative approach, as well as more numerous and less self-absorbed queens. They tend to cluster in broad social groups, \
	usually within the designated oxygen-rich 'mezzanines' each fortress-nest happily allocates to them. As mild as they are by \
	comparison to their fellows, Monarch Serpentid political and social culture is still factional and often vicious."
